> Our most important division, the infantry troops. These are the frontline fighters who specialize in infiltrating and sweeping across compounds to secure them using **overwhelming force**. This is our most aggressive division, and **if you like fast-paced gunfights, then this is where you belong.**

Support troops work alongside infantry to provide callouts, medical assistance, and fire support. **This division requires patience, tactical awareness, and observational skills.**

> `"Guardians of the Gates of Heaven."`

Helicopter pilots get troops on the ground before taking to the sky to provide covering fire and wait for an evac call. Our CAS pilots are the A-10 operators that strafe the battlefield to clear large amounts of enemies very quickly. **If you like flying and using huge mounted weaponry, then this is the division for you.**
